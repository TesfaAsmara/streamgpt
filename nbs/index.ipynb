    "\n",
    "To stream messages from Twitch IRC you need to get a to token for authentication. To do that you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Twitch account\n",
    "2. Go to https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to request an auth token for your Twitch account. You'll need to click \"Connect with Twitch\" and \"Authorize\" to produce a token\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your token should look something like \"oauth:yj23Ds7BB97Hju85QYTenVox12x03\". Including your token, there's two constants we'll define for the connection to a Twitch channel's chat feed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your Twitch account nickname \n",
    "2. The channel you want to join\n",
    "\n",
